# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Analysis stock data by developing a subroutine in VBA that generates simaltaneous information for an array of different stocks. Additionally the marco created allows the user to select the year he or she would like to analysis for the same array. Ultimately allowing for more verstility with lighting fast results. 


## Purpose

<br>

The purpose of this project was for me to begin learning the intricacies of the programming language VBA. This project took me through several different disign patterns that covered several of the fundumentals in programming pertaining not just to VBA:

<br>

 - Arrays
- Loops/Nested Loops
- Data Types/ Variables
- Syntax 
- Refactoring

    This project allowed me to also begin learning how to creativitly problem solve using code.

## Results

Below are three images displaying different messageboxs showing how long it took for the macro to be ran. As seen in the first image the time was just shy of 1 sec. This was the timer for the first macro that displayed all stock information and also incorporated formatting.

Incomparison to the others this inital marco doesnt seem to be that much slower but the fact of the matter is took more processing power. Which translates to lose time.

Through refactoring the code was not only condensed but allowed for faster processing.

One disadvantage to the refactoing is all though the code was inessance better, it did take additional "manhours" to do so. For this project the orginal macro would have satisfied for the clients needs.
